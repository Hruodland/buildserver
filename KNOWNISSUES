Issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------
001 2015/06/09: Keystore import:
  On fedora needed to manually import into local keystore if you
  start off from scratch since it needs su and the playbook
  doesn't do su by default. (It should maybe use sudo when the keystore
  is in a location like /etc/pka,  not if it is in $JAVA_HOME.)

  Command:
    sudo keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file
    pki/buildserverCA.cer -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias
    dev -keystore /etc/pki/java/cacerts

002 20150609: Nexus download resulted sometimes in corrupt tgz package.

003 20150609: vagrant provision target error: Postgres startup fails, ipv6 related issue.

004 Testing war deployment to tomcat.
    The last test of getting the war file from dev may fail.
    This may be related to the minimal amount of memory.

    1 Jenkins is not finished bulding at that point in time.
    2 Sometimes the build fails, it cannot contact nexus, first open a web page to nexus then try a
      rebuild in Jenkins and wait for a green light for the build.
    3 Then manually run the last line of the deploy step from the Makefile.

-merge windows with cygwin. (For now try yourself)
-create a playbook for  local cygwin setup. or use a  vagrant local privider plugin:
